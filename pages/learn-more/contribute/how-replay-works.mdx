[Replay.io](http://Replay.io) is the first time-travel debugger for runtimes like the browser and Node.

We wrote some blog posts outlining how it worked, covering the basics of how we record OS syscalls, use ‚Äúeffective determinism‚Äù to minimize the data needed, and turn browser processes in the cloud into a public API that can be used to introspect a program‚Äôs behavior:

2. [Recording and Replaying](https://medium.com/replay-io/recording-and-replaying-d6102afee273)

4. [Inspecting Runtimes](https://medium.com/replay-io/inspecting-runtimes-caeca007a4b1)

There‚Äôs also a recent set of posts talking about the ‚Äúeffective determinism‚Äù aspect in more detail, including how we can replay the full browser behavior with a relatively small recorded set of input data, and how we investigate ‚Äúruntime mismatch‚Äù errors internally:
