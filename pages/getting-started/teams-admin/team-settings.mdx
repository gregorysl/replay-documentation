From the settings menu, you can:

- Update team name
- Add/update team logo
- Update Organization settings ([Organization plan required](https://www.replay.io/pricing))
- Manage member access
- Update billing information ([Admin role only](/media/getting-started/teams-admin/team-settings.md))
- Generate [API Keys](/media/getting-started/teams-admin/team-settings.md) for automated recordings
- Delete team

## User Role Definitions

Replay users are either Users or Developers. Our plans charge by Developer seat. All role types within a team are able to make any replay within the team public. 

- **Developers** have full debugging capabilities, including access to print statements and console evaluation
- **Users** can record replays and have some DevTools functionality, but they cannot edit a print statement or evaluate in the console
- **Admins** have access to Billing information. Either role type can also be made an Admin, and you can have as many Admins on a team as you want

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
ðŸ‘‰ While you are only charged for Developer seats, both Developers and Users contribute to the [user limits for our Team and Organization plans](https://www.replay.io/pricing) and recordings per month.

## Updating user roles

User roles can be updated any time in the Team Settings in your Replay Library. **Addition or removal of Developer seats will be automatically applied to your plan and your billing will updated on a prorated basis.**

## Organization Settings

Organization plans have additional features that can be enabled from the Organization tab in Team Settings. See [Premium Features](/getting-started/teams-admin/organization-features) for more details.

## API Key Setup and Limits

Teams can create API Keys for uploading [source maps](/pages/getting-started/teams-admin/uploading-source-maps) during deploys or uploading replays of [automated tests](https://www.notion.so/Test-Suites-5bf7d91b65cd46deab1867b07bd12bdf?pvs=21). The number of recordings allowed is based on your plan.
