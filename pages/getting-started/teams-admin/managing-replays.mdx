# Managing replays

### Moving replays between teams

There are two ways to transfer a replay between teams.

1. The actions dropdown in the Library
2. The privacy dropdown in the replay Info Panel

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
ðŸ’¡ The replayâ€™s author will still have access after you move the recording to a new team.

</Callout>
