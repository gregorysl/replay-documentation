# Viewing and collaborating

## Viewing your application

Itâ€™s important to get a sense of what was happening in the app at the time of the issue. With the [Viewer](https://www.notion.so/Viewer-26591deb256c473a946d0f64abb67859?pvs=21), you can see the browser capture and user events in a timeline view.

## Collaborating with comments

We believe that there is no shame in bugs, and that asking for help can be a critical step in the debugging process. We make this easy by letting you [add comments](https://www.notion.so/Commenting-0a140c06524d428681cadd78acf44661?pvs=21) at different points in the replay.

Use comments to:

- Note moments in time where bugs or issues occur.
- Ask questions about unexpected behavior.
- Identify functions or lines of code that are problematic.
- Share the good news when youâ€™ve identified the source of a bug!
