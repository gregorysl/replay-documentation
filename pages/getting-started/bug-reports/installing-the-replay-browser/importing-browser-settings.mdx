The first time you open the Replay Browser, you may be prompted to import your settings and data from another browser. **This is not required**, but may be helpful if you want access to data like saved passwords while recording with Replay.

You can also import these later by selecting *File > Import From Another Browser* in the Replay Browser menu.
