# Installing Replay Chrome

Replay Chrome is currently built for automated recordings with tools like Playwright and Cypress so it does not have a record button yet. If you would like to use Chrome to record a replay, you can use the `replay` CLI.

## Dependencies

Replay Chrome should work on most modern versions of Linux, but it does require a relatively modern version of libc (v2.27+). Weâ€™ve tested Replay Chrome against the following versions of Ubuntu:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
 Installing the replay CLI globally will add `replay` to your path so you can skip `npx` and just call `replay` directly

`npm i -g @replayio/replay`

</Callout>

## Launching Chrome

```bash
npx @replayio/replay@latest launch https://replay.io
```

# Viewing a replay

Replay Chrome will record every tab by default. When you want to view a replay, you can use the `replay` CLI to either upload the most recent recording or view the most recent recordings and upload just the one you want.

```bash
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY=<API_Key> npx @replayio/replay@latest view-latest
```

or 

```bash
npx @replayio/replay@latest ls
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY=<API_Key> npx @replayio/replay@latest upload <id>
```

You can create an API Key for either a [team](/getting-started/teams-admin/setting-up-a-team#api-keys) or your [user](/resources/get-help/user-settings) account.

## Installation troubleshooting

### glibc not found

If youâ€™re getting an error like the following:

```
version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by /tmp/linux-chromium-20230823-2775ccebda6-2b20bc943835.so)
```

Try installing a more modern version of libc. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-9 libstdc++6
```
