# Test Suite integration

## Overview

[Replay.io](https://Replay.io) lets you record your browser tests in CI and debug them later with Browser DevTools. If youâ€™ve ever struggled to understand why a test fails intermittently in CI, but passes when you run it locally, Replay can help.

**Join the waitlist**

Replay for Test Suites was released in June as a beta so that we can help each team setup Replay and fix their flakes. If youâ€™d like to start recording your tests, join our [**waitlist**](https://replayio.typeform.com/to/jTudlerL) and weâ€™ll reach out to you as soon as possible. Also feel free joining our [**Discord**](https://replay.io/discord) #testing channel or emailing us at hey@replay.io.

**Features**

- Cypress Panel
- Playwright Panel

- Network Monitor
- Console

**Benefits**

- Inspect **Cypress** **step details**
- Add **console logs** to any line of application code
- View **network request** and response bodies
- Jump from a **Cypress step** into the React event handler
- Jump from **console exceptions** into your application code.
- Find **timing inconsistencies** between passing and failing tests.

## Test Suite Dashboard

The **Test Suite Dashboard** provides insights into your test suite. For example, you can see how many tests failed in a given run, or view the history of a specific test to see when it started failing.

The **Test Suite Dashboard** also serves as a launching off point. If you want to see why a recent change caused several tests to fail, you can go to the dashboard, and open each of the replays and begin debugging.

**Features**

- Test run view
- Test run summary
- Flaky test overview
- Links to replays

**Benefits**

- See when tests began failing
- See which tests are flaky tests
- Debug flaky and failed tests

## Test Runners

Because [Replay.io](https://Replay.io) has a fork of Chrome and Node that you can use to record your browser and unit tests, at a high level recording your tests is as simple as pointing your tests at the Replay runtime. 

Because it can also be nice to see your test steps when youâ€™re debugging your test in Replay DevTools weâ€™ve built plugins for Cypress and Playwright that bring the Cypress App and Playwright Trace viewer debugging experience into Replay DevTools. 

**Plugin Support**

- [Cypress](/test-suites/cypress/getting-started)
- [Playwright](/test-suites/playwright)

**Runtime support**

- [Puppeteer](/test-suites/puppeteer)
- [WebdriverIO](/test-suites/webdriver-io)
- [Jest](/test-suites/jest) (alpha)

## CI Environments

Because recording your tests is as simple as running them with the Replay browser, you can record your test suite in any environment. Because each environment is slightly different, weâ€™re beginning to collect best practices which we are sharing below.

- [CircleCI](/test-suites/ci-integration/circle-ci)
- [Github Actions](/test-suites/ci-integration/github-actions)
