## User Role Definitions

Replay users are either Users or Developers. Our plans charge by Developer seat. All role types within a team are able to make any replay within the team public. 

- **Developers** have full debugging capabilities, including access to print statements and console evaluation
- **Users** can record replays and have some DevTools functionality, but they cannot edit a print statement or evaluate in the console
- **Admins** have access to Billing information. Either role type can also be made an Admin, and you can have as many Admins on a team as you want

<aside>
ðŸ‘‰ While you are only charged for Developer seats, both Developers and Users contribute to the [user limits for our Team and Organization plans](https://www.replay.io/pricing) and recordings per month.

## Updating user roles

User roles can be updated any time in the Team Settings in your Replay Library. **Addition or removal of Developer seats will be automatically applied to your plan and your billing will updated on a prorated basis.**
