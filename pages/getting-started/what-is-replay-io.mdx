# What is Replay.io?
**Replay.io is a tool that makes debugging easy.** It lets you record your web app and retroactively inspect it using print statements and browser DevTools. 

Recordings created with Replay allow you to travel back in time to any state of your application and then add breakpoints and `console.log(){:js}` to any place in your code. This allows you to debug as if your application is running locally. 

## Why use Replay.io?
Typically, you would use Replay to debug, or better understand your app. The journey with Replay.io would have three chapters:
<Steps>
### Create a recording
You can create a recording manually:

<Video src="/videos/record-replay_ousuj.mp4" />

or by integrating Replay.io to your Test Suite:
```bash
# cypress
npx cypress run --browser replay-chromium
# playwright
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```
### Replay the recording and debug your app
<Video src="/videos/replay-dashboard_pttbf.mp4" />

### Fix the bug or get help
With a better understanding of data flows, state changes and other processes in your app, you can now fix your bug. Or even better, send a recording to your colleague to debug together.

</Steps>

## Common use cases
- <Icon><DesktopCursor /></Icon> **Local debugging**: developers use Replay to better understand how their application works and debug difficult bugs.
- <Icon><Bug /></Icon> **Bug reports**: teams use Replay to record bug reports in their Support and QA workflows so that developers can debug the issues without having to reproduce it locally.
- <Icon><TestTube /></Icon> **Flaky and failed tests**: teams use Replay to record their end-to-end tests in CI so that developers can debug flaky and failed tests.

## How does Replay.io compare to Session Replay tools?
Replay records the runtime so you can retroactively debug your application with print statements and Browser DevTools. Session Replay tools like Full story record the DOM so you can see how your users use your application.

## See Replay in action
If youâ€™re a visual learner, youâ€™ll enjoy Filip Hricâ€™s video Time Travelling with Replay.io. In the video, he shares his initial impressions of Replay and walks through how Replay helps him debug his application locally and debug Cypress flakes in CI.
