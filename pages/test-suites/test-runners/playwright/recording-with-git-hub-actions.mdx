# Using the Replay `action-playwright`

Using Replayâ€™s `[action-playwright](https://github.com/replayio/action-playwright)` in your GitHub Actions workflow is the easiest way to get started recording your Playwright tests in CI.

The action:

- Runs your tests with the browser set for a given project
- Uploads replays from the test run to the team associated with the given API key

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš§">
If your workflow does not have a step to install project dependencies, youâ€™ll need to add a step to install `@replayio/playwright` before using `action-playwright`.
</Callout>

**This action should not be used in combination with other actions that execute a test run command.**

[Full instructions at the `action-playwright` repository.](https://github.com/replayio/action-playwright)

# Using other GitHub Actions

If youâ€™d like to use a different action or workflow step to execute your tests, you can still configure GitHub Actions to record and upload replays.

If your workflow does not have a step to install project dependencies, youâ€™ll need to add a step to install `@replayio/playwright` before using `action-playwright`.

```yaml
- name: Install Replay Playwright
  run: npx @replayio/playwright install
```

## Recording replays

Your existing test run command (for example, `npx playwright test`) must be updated to include the name of a Replay Browser and required environment variables to record. 

You should make this update wherever your run command is defined, typically in `package.json` or directly in the workflow file:

- Pass the `--project` flag, and your selected browser option:
    - `--project project-name` (`replay-chromium` or `replay-firefox` )
    - Currently supported browser options are `replay-chromium` (Linux) or `replay-firefox` (maxOS, Linux)
- Pass the `--reporter` flag like this:
    - `--reporter=@replayio/playwright/reporter,line`

For example, to use Replay Chromium, the command is:

```bash
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium --reporter=@replayio/playwright/reporter,line
```

**If you donâ€™t specify a project, all projects defined in your config will run.**

## Uploading replays

Use `[replayio/action-upload](https://github.com/replayio/action-upload)` to upload replays generated during the test run.

```yaml
- name: Upload replays
  if: ${{ always() }}
  uses: replayio/action-upload@v0.5.1
  with:
    public: true
    api-key: ${{ secrets.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY }}
```

You can also use the `@replayio/replay` CLI to upload replays. [See instructions here]/Cypress/Cypress-Instructions-(archived)/Recording-with-Other-CI-Providers.md).
