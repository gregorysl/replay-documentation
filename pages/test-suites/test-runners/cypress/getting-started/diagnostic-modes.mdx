# Diagnostic Modes

The `@replayio/cypress` plugin includes a cypress runner that includes diagnostic modes to help identify issues with the Replay browsers. The runner uses [cypressâ€™s module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) to invoke cypress multiple times with different environment variables to adjust the behavior of the Replay browser.

```bash
npx @replayio/cypress run --mode <mode> <...other cypress parameters>
```

# Record on Retry

```bash
npx @replayio/cypress run --mode record-on-retry
```

Runs the test suite once with recording disabled and if any specs fail, those are re-ran with recording enabled.

# Stress

```bash
npx @replayio/cypress run --mode stress
```

Runs the test suite 10 times regardless of test result

# Diagnostics

```bash
npx @replayio/cypress run --mode diagnostics --level basic
```

## Basic

When level is set to `basic`, the test suite is run 3 times:

1. Recording disabled
2. Recording enabled
3. Recording enabled with debug assertions disabled

## Full

When level is set to `full`, the test suite is run *many* times (currently 38) with each run disabling a different browser feature. Due to the number of runs, this should often be limited to a specific spec file that is failing.

```bash
npx @replayio/cypress run --mode diagnostics --level full --spec cypress/e2e/failing-spec.ts
```

### Running a test case multiple times in development

If you want to quickly reproduce a flaky test, you can also re-run the test case in a loop several times as well. This strategy can sometimes be easier if you want to quickly record a flake locally.

```jsx

describe('Verify "Login" is visible. Test: '+i, () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3 ; i++) {
    it('finds the Login link in the header', () => {
      //Place code inside the loop that you want to repeat
    })
  }
})

```
