# Getting Started

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
This guide assumes that you already have a Cypress 10.9+ test suite. If you‚Äôre just setting up your Cypress test suite, first follow the instructions [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress).
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Installing the Replay plugin

Install the `[@replayio/cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replayio/cypress)` package in your project:

```bash
npm install @replayio/cypress -D
```

Add the Replay plugin to `cypress.config.js`

```jsx
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');
// üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Add this line to require the replay plugin
const { plugin: replayPlugin } = require("@replayio/cypress")

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Add this line to install the replay plugin
      replayPlugin(on, config);
      // Make sure that setupNodeEvents returns config
      return config;
    },
  },
});
```

Add this line your [support file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e), which should be `cypress/support/e2e.js` for e2e tests (unless modified)

```jsx
// cypress/support/e2e.js
require('@replayio/cypress/support');
```

After the setup is complete, you can now try running your tests locally with the Replay browser:

```bash
npx cypress run --browser=replay-chromium
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="üöß">
Replay Chromium is GA on Linux and beta for Mac and Windows!

</Callout>

### Uploading and viewing replays

We recommend creating a new team in Replay to organize your Cypress replays. You‚Äôll also need an API Key to upload your replays and team API keys have much higher limits than personal API keys.

1. Visit [app.replay.io/team/new](http://app.replay.io/team/new) to create a team.
2. Once you‚Äôve created a team, [create a new API Key](/pages/getting-started/teams-admin/team-settings).
3. Save that API in your [GitHub Repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) as `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` so it‚Äôs available for the workflow we‚Äôll make next!

### Setting up your CI environment

Here‚Äôs a basic GitHub Action configuration which you can add to you project as `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` to get started.

```yaml
name: End-to-end tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5.1.0
        with:
          browser: replay-chromium
          build: npm run build
          start: npm start
        env:
          REPLAY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY }}

      # Always run this step so failed tests are uploaded
      - name: Upload replays
        if: always()
        uses: replayio/action-upload@v0.5.1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY }}
```
</Steps>

The steps may be different depending on how you run tests in CI, so pick one of the options below that best applies to you.
