# Test Suites

Integrating Replay Browser into your test suite is as easy as telling your test framework which browser to run on. A simplified example for each test framework of integration will look something like this:

<Tabs items={['Playwright', 'Cypress.io', 'WebdriverIO', 'Puppeteer']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```
<p className="text-sm">[Click here](/test-suites/test-runners/playwright) Learn more about how to integrate into Playwright</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npx cypress run --browser replay-chromium
```
<p className="text-sm">[Click here](/test-suites/test-runners/cypress) Learn more about how to integrate into Cypress</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts # Read docs on how to set up your configuration
```
<p className="text-sm">[Click here](/test-suites/test-runners/webdriver-io) Learn more about how to integrate into WebdriverIO</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
node puppeteer-test.js # Read docs on how to set up your configuration
```
<p className="text-sm">[Click here](/test-suites/test-runners/puppeteer) Learn more about how to integrate into Puppeteer</p>
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Whenever you run your tests, the test execution will be recorded and a replay will be created. This allows you to debug failures, analyse the root cause of a flaky test and much more. With frameworks such as Playwright and Cypress, we bring you a custom sidebar that allows you to examine each test step.

## Benefits of integrating Replay to your test suite
<Features />

## Dashboard
The **Test Suite Dashboard** provides you with an overview of all the tests and test runs that were recorded with Replay Browser. This will serve you as a great reporter tool, but with every test result, youâ€™ll have access to the test recording. If anything went wrong, you can start debugging with all the powers that Replay DevTools provide you with.

Each test run contains information on failed, passed and flaky tests. 

You can choose to open a replay that ran on a failed test, or start debugging a flaky one.

The **Test Suite Dashboard** is your launching off point. If you want to see why a recent change caused several tests to fail, you can go to the dashboard, and open each of the replays and begin debugging.

## Replay DevTools

Replay DevTools enable you to see what happened during your test run. This is great for flaky tests and revealing timing issues that tend to happen when running end-to-end tests. You can deep dive into your test code as well as your application code and make your app and tests work well together.

### Cypress panel

Examine each command step by step, travel back in time and see what each command returned. This will bring the great experience from your local Cypress GUI mode into your CI execution as well.

For action commands, you can click "Jump to code" to see what part of your application code was actually triggered.
