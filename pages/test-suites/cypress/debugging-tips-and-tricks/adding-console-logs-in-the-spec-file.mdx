# Adding console logs in the spec file

<LoomVideo src="https://www.loom.com/embed/64839a8f075a41cabf105d671cc48a07" />

Typically console logs are not that helpful in a spec file because the spec is run at the beginning of the test to build the test plan.

The exception for the rule is `.should` and other cases where the test code is run in the middle of the test and there are values that can be inspected.
