# Debugging Guide

## Adding console logs in the spec file

Typically console logs are not that helpful in a spec file because the spec is run at the beginning of the test to build the test plan.

The exception for the rule is `.should` and other cases where the test code is run in the middle of the test and there are values that can be inspected.

## Evaluating in Cypress callbacks

Most Cypress steps run at test start to build the test schedule. An exception to this rule is Cypress commands and should assertions.

In these cases you can jump to a line of code and evaluate expressions in the Console’s terminal.

1. Hold down command and click the blue jump button
2. Evaluate an expression in the Console’s terminal

## Jump to application events

With Replay you can jump from a test `click` command into your React component’s `onClick` hander. In the example below, we jump from the test’s click command into the Todo app’s `handleEdit` callback.
