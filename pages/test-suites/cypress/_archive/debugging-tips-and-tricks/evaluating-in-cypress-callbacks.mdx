# Evaluating in Cypress callbacks

Most Cypress steps run at test start to build the test schedule. An exception to this rule is Cypress commands and should assertions.

In these cases you can jump to a line of code and evaluate expressions in the Console’s terminal.

1. Hold down command and click the blue jump button
2. Evaluate an expression in the Console’s terminal
