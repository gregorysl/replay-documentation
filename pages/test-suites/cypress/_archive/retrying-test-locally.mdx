#### Running a test case multiple times in development

If you want to quickly reproduce a flaky test, you can also re-run the test case in a loop several times as well. This strategy can sometimes be easier if you want to quickly record a flake locally.

```jsx

describe('Verify "Login" is visible. Test: '+i, () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3 ; i++) {
    it('finds the Login link in the header', () => {
      //Place code inside the loop that you want to repeat
    })
  }
})

```
