# Cypress Panel with Replay DevTools
Every recorded test can be viewed in Replay DevTools which will help you find root causes of any hidden instabilities. With Cypress panel, you’ll get additional information about the test itself. The experience is very similar to Cypress GUI mode, but there are small differences that allow you to dive deeper into your test recording.

## Command details
Clicking on any command in Cypress panel will reveal its details. You can inspect element queries, actions and assertions. When a command is focused, Source code panel will jump to the corresponding line in your spec file.

### Queries
Details of [query commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents#Queries) such as `cy.get(){:js}` or `cy.contains(){:js}` contain information on selected elements and number of elements found. Clicking on target <TargetElement className='w-5 h-5 inline-block' /> icon will highlight the selected element in Viewer panel.

Additionally, you can right-click on the target <TargetElement className='w-5 h-5 inline-block' /> icon to reveal the option to copy the HTML element.

### Actions
With [action commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents#Actions) such as `cy.type(){:js}` or `cy.click(){:js}` you’ll get information on coordinates of where given command was triggered as well any parameters passed to that command. This includes text that was typed in, or i.e. `{force:true}{:js}` options.

### Assertions
Cypress assertions can be viewed in great detail. Every assertion contains the assertion message, subject of the assertion as well as the expected value.

In case of a failed assertion, you can view complete details of the expected and actual value. This provides you with additional details that can normally get concatenated in a terminal message or in a failure screenshot.

## Network activity
Network requests are captured the same way as in Cypress GUI mode. In the network panel inside DevTools, you can take a better detail into different parts of an XHR call. For example, you can review the stack trace or timings of certain API calls.

## Jump to code
Hovering over <span className='font-mono bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full p-1 mx-1'><JumpTo className="w-5 h-5 inline-block p-0.5 mb-0.5" /></span> icon will reveal the <span className='mx-1.5 font-mono bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-3xl px-3 py-1'>Jump to code  <JumpTo className="w-5 h-5 inline-block p-0.5 mb-0.5" /></span> button. This button is a bridge between your test and the application under test. Clicking on this button will take you to the part of code that was executed when a Cypress command was called. This helps further examining what happened during your test.
