# Playwright

## Setting up a team

You‚Äôll need a Replay team specifically for your automated test replays. This lets you set up an API key for recording in CI and provides 

Start by creating a new team in the **[Replay Library](https://app.replay.io)** sidebar and inviting your team members. Once created, we‚Äôll enable access to the **Test Suite Dashboard**. 

When you‚Äôre ready to record, you can create an [API Key from the Team Settings]/Teams-&-Admin/Team-Settings.md). Using the API Key connects your recordings to the correct team to ensure access to your replays is protected and your Test Suite Dashboard views are accurate.

## Configuring Playwright

Replay records automated browser tests by replacing the browser normally used to run your tests. Playwright must be configured to launch the Replay Browser to generate recordings.

Make sure you‚Äôre using Playwright version 1.19.2.

## Installation

Run the following in your project directory:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm install @replayio/playwright -D
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn add @replayio/playwright -D
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

This installs the Replay Browsers on your machine and provides functionality for recording tests with Replay.

## **Configuration**

In your `playwright.config.ts` file, import `devices` from `@replayio/playwright`. 

This gives you access to ‚ÄúReplay Firefox‚Äù and ‚ÄúReplay Chromium‚Äù devices to set the browser in your config using [Playwright projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#multiple-browsers). 

**Example config:**

```tsx
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices } from "@replayio/playwright";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-firefox",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Firefox"] as any },
    },
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] as any },
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] },
    },
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chromium"] },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

This example also includes projects for running your tests without recording using Firefox and Chromium, imported from `@playwright/test`. Only the `replay-firefox` and `replay-chromium` projects will generate replays.

## Recording tests in CI

Replay is designed to record tests in CI so you can debug when tests fail. Without Replay, test failures in CI are like a black box, with little insights into what went wrong. By recording with Replay, you get a full recording of the test run with debugging tools built in.

Configuration instructions will vary based on your CI provider and pipeline.

## Recording tests locally

While Replay Test Suites is designed for debugging tests in CI, it can be helpful to record a test locally for additional debugging or when first getting set up. 

### Recording replays

- Ensure your project is configured with `replayio/playwright`
- Configure Playwright to only use a single worker and increase the timeout if needed to allow for increased run time. See config example below.
- Set `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` as an environment variable locally
- Pass the `--project` flag, and your selected browser option:
    - `--project project-name` (`replay-chromium` or `replay-firefox` )
    - Currently supported browser options are `replay-chromium` (Linux) or `replay-firefox` (maxOS, Linux)
- Pass the `--reporter` flag like this:
    - `--reporter=@replayio/playwright/reporter,line`

For example, to use Replay Firefox (macOS, Linux), the command is:

```bash
npx playwright test --project replay-firefox --reporter=@replayio/playwright/reporter,line
```

**If you don‚Äôt specify a project, all projects defined in your config will run.**

**Config example:**

```jsx
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices } from "@replayio/playwright";

const inCI = !!process.env.CI;

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  timeout: !inCI ? 30 * 1000 : 10 * 1000,
  workers: !inCI ? 1 : undefined,
  use: {
    baseURL: !inCI ? "http://localhost:3000" : undefined,
    launchOptions: {
      slowMo: inCI ? 0 : 500,
    },
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-firefox",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Firefox"] as any },
    },
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] as any },
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] },
    },
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chromium"] },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

We recommend using the [options available in Playwright to only run certain tests as needed](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests).

## Uploading replays

Replays are uploaded locally using the `@replayio/replay` CLI. Your API key must be set as the `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` environment variable to upload.

- To see available replays for upload, use `npx @replayio/replay ls`
- To upload a single replay, use `npx @replayio/replay upload <id>`
- To upload all available replays, use `npx @replayio/replay upload-all`
