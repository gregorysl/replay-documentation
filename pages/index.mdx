# What is Replay.io?
Replay.io is a tool that lets you record your web app and retroactively inspect it using print statements and browser DevTools. 

Recordings created with Replay allow you to travel back in time to any state of your application and then add breakpoints and `console.log(){:js}` to any place in your code. This allows you to debug as if your application is running locally. 

## Why use Replay.io?
Typically, you would use Replay to debug, or better understand your app. The journey with Replay.io would have three chapters:
<Steps>
### Create a recording
You can create a recording manually:

<video autoPlay muted loop width="80%" className="p-4">
  <source src='/media/record-replay.mp4' type="video/mp4" />
</video>

or by integrating Replay.io to your Test Suite:
```bash
# cypress
npx cypress run --browser replay-chromium
# playwright
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```
### Replay the recording and debug your app
<video autoPlay muted loop width="80%" className="p-4">
  <source src='/media/replay-dashboard.mp4' type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### Fix the bug or get help
With a better understanding of data flows, state changes and other processes in your app, you can now fix your bug. Or even better, send a recording to your colleague to debug together.

<video autoPlay muted loop width="80%" className="p-4">
  <source src='/media/share.mp4' type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</Steps>

## Common use cases
- <Icon><DesktopCursor /></Icon> **Local debugging**: developers use Replay to better understand how their application works and debug difficult bugs.
- <Icon><Bug /></Icon> **Bug reports**: teams use Replay to record bug reports in their Support and QA workflows so that developers can debug the issues without having to reproduce it locally.
- <Icon><TestTube /></Icon> **Flaky and failed tests**: teams use Replay to record their end-to-end tests in CI so that developers can debug flaky and failed tests.

## What makes Replay.io special?
- **Itâ€™s collaborative** - Replay.io makes it possible to build a collaborative debugging experience. Think Chrome DevTools meets Google Docs.
- **Itâ€™s focused** - The first thing youâ€™ll notice when you open a Replay is the Jump to Code button which lets you jump from an event into event handler.
- **Itâ€™s interactive** - You can go to any point of your recording and add a `console.log(){:js}` and examine any expression at that point of time. Itâ€™s like `console.log(){:js}`, but retroactive
- **Itâ€™s cutting-edge** - These features are a result of some serious engineering. All this would not be possible without the ability to replay the browser and integrate deeply into React. And weâ€™re just getting started, if youâ€™d like to see where weâ€™re headed, check out our React and Replayability roadmap. {/* TODO: add link to Replayability roadmap */}

## How does Replay.io compare to Session Replay tools?
Replay records the runtime so you can retroactively debug your application with print statements and Browser DevTools. Session Replay tools like Full story record the DOM so you can see how your users use your application.
